# Numerical Methods Learning 

This repo is a collection of implementations of algorithms drawn from *Numerical Algorithms: Methods for Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Graphics* (2015). This is purely a learning exercise. 

I am in the very early stages of this exercise and the work isn't polished yet. I am still deciding where exactly I want to take it. Right now I am hoping to implement each algorithm/technique in C. I may extend it by implementing them in Python as well and comparing the performance difference.
